      <p>
        When I'm not coding or studying, you can find me exploring the outdoors
        through playing tennis or hiking. I love connecting with nature and
        staying active, whether it's on the court or taking a nice walk.
        Spending time outdoors helps me recharge by taking some time off work,
        doing something that I love.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm excited about the future of technology and my role in contributing
        to its evolution. If you'd like to connect or learn more, feel free to
        contact me through my social media links or email!
